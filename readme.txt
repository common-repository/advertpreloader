AdvertLoader is a plugin designed to increase your earnings by using adverts which will be shown to users just before all other content loads. 

== Description ==

How does it work?

The plugin is fully configurable and can be set to appear on posts, pages or any other type of entry for which you activate the preloader. Before users can see the content of a page (texts, pictures, video) the plugin displays a message stating that the content is currently loading, providing you with an option to put an advert, a picture, or a piece of text just below the message. You can define almost all parameters regarding the look of the preloader (from the loading animation, the duration of the loading to the various ways the preloader can be shown). 

In which situations can the preloader be used?

*To display ads on premium content pages! By using this method, youâ€™ll make users see the advert for a certain time period before they can see the content of the page.

*When loading a video. You can inform users that the video is being loaded, while showing them an advert or an important message at the same time.

*To show the terms of service or protect users from inappropriate content. If your page features adult content you can set the preloader to display a ten second message which will inform potential visitors that the site is intended for a 18+ audience, asking them to click on the continue button in order to view the content.
